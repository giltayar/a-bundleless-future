# 01-one-file

```

## Basic use

To see the web app, just run `npm start` and navigate with your browser to
 <http://localhost:3000>.

## Explanation

The HTML is in [`./src/index.html`](./src/index.html) and, like all modern web apps,
is a simple HTML that mostly `<script src>`-s the JavaScript code in [`./src/01-one-file.js`](./src/01-one-file.js).

The JavaScript is a Vanilla JS app that displays the infamous "Counter Component".

Nothing to see here: just one JavaScript file with no imports or
exports.
